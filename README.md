Radio Astronomy meets AI: Using Scikit-Learn to simulate spectral analysis and unsupervised clustering of astronomical data.

# Astro-ML: Radio Astronomy & Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Python projects exploring the intersection of **Radio Astronomy** and **Data Science/AI**. The goal is to apply modern Machine Learning techniques to fundamental astrophysical problems, demonstrating how AI can "rediscover" physics and automate data analysis.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
    * `numpy` (Data generation & Physics calculations)
    * `matplotlib` (Scientific visualization)
    * `scikit-learn` (Neural Networks & Clustering algorithms)

## Context

These projects were developed as part of a structured study roadmap in **Radio Astronomy**, bridging the gap between theoretical astrophysics (NRAO ERA Course) and modern computational methods.

Disclaimer: `Synthetic Data` Please note that the datasets used in these projects are synthetic and generated programmatically using Python (NumPy). While the data is based on standard astrophysical formulas (e.g., Planck’s Law, Rayleigh-Jeans approximation) and includes simulated noise to mimic realistic conditions, it does not represent actual observational data from a specific telescope or survey. These projects are intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
